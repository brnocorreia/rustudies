## Distributed State Machine

### What is a DSM?

- A Distributed State Machine is a system that:
  - Maintains state across multiple nodes in a distributed network
  - Ensures consistency of that state across all nodes
  - Manages state transitions in a coordinated way

---

### Implementation

> Our distributed state machine consists of nodes that can propose state changes, broadcast these proposals to peers, and reach consensus based on received acknowledgments. Each node listens for incoming messages and responds based on predefined rules.

---

### Goals

- In this guide, weâ€™ll walk through the creation of a simplified distributed state machine using Rust. ðŸ¦€

- Our focus will be on the core concepts needed to set up basic node communication, state proposals, and consensus among nodes.

- Keep in mind that this implementation is intended for educational purposes and to provide a foundation for more complex distributed systems.

### Real World Applications

**Distributed Databases (e.g., Apache Cassandra, CockroachDB):**

> Distributed databases use state machines to replicate data across multiple nodes, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. Each write operation is a state transition, and consistency is maintained through consensus protocols.

**Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin):**

> Blockchain technology is essentially a distributed state machine, where each block represents a state transition based on transactions. Ethereum, for example, not only tracks the state of digital currency but also the state of smart contracts, making it a global, decentralized computing platform.

**Consensus Protocols (e.g., Raft, Paxos):**

> These protocols are foundational to implementing distributed state machines, ensuring all nodes in a distributed system agree on a single source of truth. They are used in various systems, from databases to distributed filesystems, to maintain consistency.

**Distributed File Systems (e.g., IPFS, HDFS):**

> Distributed file systems manage data across multiple servers. They use state machines to track the location and status of each file fragment, ensuring data is accessible even if parts of the system fail.

**Distributed Configuration Management (e.g., etcd, ZooKeeper):**

> These systems provide a reliable way to store and retrieve configuration settings for distributed systems. They rely on distributed state machines to keep configuration data consistent across a cluster of machines.

**Distributed Ledgers (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric):**

> Used in enterprise blockchain solutions, distributed ledgers use state machines to ensure that all participants have a consistent view of the ledger. This is crucial for applications like supply chain tracking, where multiple parties need a reliable and shared source of truth.

**Real-time Collaboration Tools (e.g., Google Docs):**

> These applications allow multiple users to edit a document simultaneously. Behind the scenes, a distributed state machine ensures that all changes are consistently applied, so every user sees the same version of the document.
