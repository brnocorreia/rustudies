## Chat Tokio Stream

### What is Chat Tokio Stream?

- A real-time chat server implementation using Rust and Tokio
- Enables multiple users to connect and communicate in a shared chat room
- Built using Tokio's asynchronous runtime and broadcast channels
- Demonstrates practical async/await patterns in network programming

---

### Implementation

Chat Tokio Stream uses TCP sockets for client connections and leverages Tokio's broadcast channels to efficiently distribute messages to all connected clients. Each client connection runs in its own asynchronous task, allowing the server to handle many concurrent users with minimal resource usage.

Key features:

- Nickname-based user identification
- Real-time message broadcasting
- Connection status notifications
- Reserved nickname protection
- Concurrent client handling

---

### Goals

- Demonstrate how to build a scalable, real-time communication system using Rust's async capabilities
- Provide a practical example of Tokio streams, channels, and TCP networking
- Serve as a foundation for more complex chat applications with additional features
- Showcase efficient memory and thread usage through Rust's ownership model and Tokio's task system

### Real World Applications

**Messaging Applications:**

> Modern messaging platforms like Slack, Discord, and WhatsApp rely on similar architectures to handle millions of concurrent users and real-time message delivery.

**Collaborative Tools:**

> Real-time collaboration tools such as Google Docs and Figma use similar pub/sub models to propagate changes between users.

**Game Servers:**

> Multiplayer game servers use real-time message broadcasting for in-game chat and game state synchronization.

**IoT Command and Control:**

> IoT systems often use similar pub/sub architectures to distribute commands and collect data from numerous connected devices.

**Customer Support Systems:**

> Live chat support systems leverage similar technology to connect customers with support representatives in real time.

**Event-Driven Microservices:**

> Microservice architectures use message passing patterns similar to this chat server to communicate between services.

**Streaming Data Platforms:**

> Systems that process high-throughput streaming data, like log aggregators or monitoring systems, use comparable messaging patterns.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the server:
   ```
   cd chat-tokio-stream && cargo run
   ```
3. Connect to the server using telnet or a similar TCP client:

   ```
   telnet localhost 8080

   nc localhost 8080
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to enter your nickname and start chatting
